%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

This report describes the existing state of software metadata and marketplaces within the NFDI as a prerequisite for the work in the nfdi.software project, which builds upon it.
To obtain an accurate and current picture of the current state, a survey was conducted within the NFDI.
In total, 140 people started the survey and 51 finished it between 03 March 2025 and the extended end date of 14 April 2025.
Of the 26 consortia, 23 had at least one representative answer the survey, with no answer from MaRDI, NFDI4Energy and NFDIxCS.
Within their consortia, participants fulfill various roles, but mostly management, research and software development distantly followed by administrator roles and a very low amount of data stewards.
To get more users, software is disseminated by means of scientific publications closely followed by web pages and with more distance by social media.
To describe research software, the \acf{CFF} is a clear favorite but Zenodo.json and CodeMeta are used as well.

Regarding research software market places, answers were nearly tied in a three-way split given in close order:
The first group has plans to build or use one but nothing concrete yet.
The second group does not have any current plans regarding software marketplaces but would like to stay informed.
The third group does not have any current plans regarding software marketplaces and are not interested in this topic.
A further significant portion of the respondents have linked or are currently linking their software metadata to an existing software marketplace.
A minority does not have any current plans regarding software marketplaces and is not interested in this topic.

To ensure the sustainability of their services and software, consortia rely on active communities, hope the community contributes or keep contributing after the projects end in this order.

All these rankings are based both on individual responses as well as those normalized by consortium with no significant changes in relative preference.

%\section{Survey on software marketplace usage}

\section{Description}
\subsection{English}
This survey is conducted as part of the nfdi.software project to gain insights into existing research software marketplaces, metadata, and sustainability strategies within the NFDI consortia.
The responses will contribute to Deliverable D2.2 as well as other project-related activities.
The survey questions are in English but this description and the data protection guidelines at the end are also translated to German.

\subsection{German}
Diese Umfrage wird im Rahmen des nfdi.software-Projekts durchgeführt, um Einblicke in bestehende Forschungssoftware-Marktplätze, Metadaten und Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien innerhalb der NFDI-Konsortien zu gewinnen.
Die Antworten fließen in das Deliverable D2.2 sowie in weitere projektbezogene Aktivitäten ein.

\section{Welcome Message}
nfdi.software is a Base4NFDI funded project that plans to design, implement and test a central marketplace for research software in Germany which provides aid in finding software collected from distributed metadata repositories (e.g. RSE, physics.tools), related publications and code repositories (BRE).
The aim is to improve the accessibility of NFDI research data and its access with specific software packages and enable more complex (re)use of metadata and software.
The need for a central access portal for research software of the NFDI consortia arises from the growing need of the scientific disciplines of the cultural sciences, humanities and social sciences, engineering and the natural and life sciences to ensure the sustainable use and further development of research software.
nfdi.software is intended to link and coordinate independent individual developments from these areas in a federated data infrastructure.
The networking and contextualization of research software opens up the potential to use research data sustainably and to expand the spectrum of analysis and processing of research data.

We are currently in the initialization phase, so now is your chance to tell us about your existing research software, metadata, your specific needs and potentially existing marketplaces and registries!
Your responses are critical to design our infrastructure and prevent duplicate work, and we will share the evaluated responses with you, so please fill out the short survey (5-10 minutes)!

\section{Normalization}
Individual response counts are biased by different participation from the consortia.
% ranging from 0 to 11 answers per consortium.
Thus we also look into response counts normalized by consortium.
Ideally, there should be identical answers within each consortium but this isn't always the case.
%, so we also look at the differences.
However the non-normalized values also shouldn't be discounted because if we assume participation is correlated with consortium size (or expressed in another way the probability of answering is not correlated by the consortium), then we can just treat the non-normalized values as samples from the whole of NFDI and the answers as based on the individual practices.
For example, if persons $A$ and $B$ both belong to consortium $C$, and $A$ answers \emph{GitHub} and $B$ answers \emph{GitLab} to the source code question, then this doesn't need to mean that one got the answer wrong, just that there is no single answer that is valid for all people in that consortium.
Ultimately, the final rankings between base and normalized answers vary very little, so in the rest of this report they are both shown without further comments on or differentiation by normalization.
See the JuypterLab notebook \href{https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/softwaresurvey/blob/master/results.ipynb}{results.ipynb} for complete normalization, plotting and table generation code and the following snippet for the normalization core code:

Each given question $q$ out of the set of multiple choice questions $Q$ is assigned a set of possible answers $A_q$.
Each individual respondent $r$ of the 51 respondents $R$ now selects a subset $A_{q_r} \subseteq A_q$ of the answers for that question.
Base answer counts $c_a$ for each answer $a \in A_q$ are intuitively determined as:

\[ c_a = |\{r \in R: a \in A_{q_r} \}| \].

%For example, 26 of the 51 respondents chose \emph{Manager} as one of their roles (\cref{fig:role}).
For example, 2 of the 51 respondents chose \emph{Data Steward} as one of their roles, see  \cref{fig:role} and \cref{tab:results}.
However 
see \cref{fig:role_n}

Normalized counts are determined as:

\[ c{_a}' = \sum_{r \in R: a \in A_{q_r}}{\frac{1}{\mathrm{g}(r)}} \]

where $\mathrm{g}(r)$ is the number of consortia that r belongs to.

%\[ c_n = \sum_{r \in R}^{} \]

Feel free to elaborate about your existing solutions in the text fields
next to the answers.

\paragraph{}
Free form \emph{comments}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is on our forecast but no specific integration plan.
\item Our software illustrates the design of an API. Maybe it can be used as a template for developers.
\item open for concrete suggestions
\item some developments from other NFDI consortia might be interesting for us to bring own tools and software on the other market place
\item We hope to use nfdi.software as market place for our own code and also to recommend its use as a good practice during tutorials
\item streamlining with bio.tools and Bioschemas profiles
\item We have different tools and services we would like to offer to a wider audience. Our involved workflow system Galaxy pretty much already handles the market place stuff.
\item we are working on a metadata schema
\item decentral indexing of software based on standardized metadata files
\item registering our software application 
\item Currently we have software created and coming from different institutes with their own repositories or marketplaces. We probably won't change dramatically this structure, however for software and metadata created for the consortium specifically we still need to decide how to structure and manage the repositories and marketplace.
\item We plan to link our software metadata to the nfdi.software RSD and fill the RSD with entries regarding Earth System sciences
\item You don't say what counts as market place. We use GitHub and GitHub-Zenodo integration.
\item started linking or updating tool information and including it in this domain, but ran in to problems due to domain editing rights being restricted to 1 user, solution not found: https://bio.tools/t?domain=nfdi4microbiota 
\item CRAN, PyPi, SSC (Stata Boston Repository), Zenodo
\item SSH Open Marketplace as registry for curating/disseminating services/tools/training materials: https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/
\item GHGA Software is distributed via Github.com, see https://github.com/ghga-de . It is also linked to the NFDI GitHub repository (https://github.com/nfdi-de).
\item We mainly use opensource projects that are hosted on e.g. Github
\item https://helmholtz.software/software/dcache
\item At the moment, this is just an overview website showcasing all the services relevant for our individual task areas.
\item we have a gitHub organisation (NFDI4Chem)
\item I'm not sure what you mean by marketplace (as we don't sell anything), but we have out website/dashboard in which we have our offered services
\item (but others are more qualified to report on it than I am)
\item It does not go under 'Marketplace' but its Open Source and we're prepared to collaborate

\begin{answers}
\item None, when the research projects end, the software or service will stop working the next time it breaks.
\item We stop working on it when the projects end but it's
  open source.
We hope the community (e.g. developers on GitHub)
  contribute fixes and updates and we at least have someone who
  regularly checks and merges pull requests.

\item unsure
\item can't tell
\item DataPLANT advocates an open contribution and collaboration model. We are enabling the community to work following open source software development principles. We are trying to setup some basic framework to support that.
\item At least in parts commitment from participating institutions to further develop and maintain services and software beyond the life-time of the consortium. In addition, there's the hope/wish to develop some semblance of community to ensure widespread use and development beyond the consortium.
\item we attach to existing sustainable projects instead of developing new solutions 
\item We provide a living document and a demonstrator, which is usable beyond project ending.
\item Depends on the service/software
\item We do not build software, we curate metadata (swMATH)
\item I don't know.
\item Don't know
\item There is work being done to ensure sustainability, but I'm personally not aware of any concrete details. 
\item But that's of course not true for all software; but software that already existed before punch4nfdi started is likely to be continued
